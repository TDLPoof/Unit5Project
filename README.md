Unit 5 Project: Hunting Simulator

In this simulation, you play as a predator attempting to survive for as many days as possible.
You can eat prey items for sustenance, and failing to eat a certain amount of food per day will
result in your death (how sad). The prey that you do not eat will reproduce, producing new targets
with different stats. Can you keep the prey from becoming too strong by natural selection?

This project makes use of the `extends` keyword to distinguish between **`Predator`** and **`Prey`**,
which are both members of the **`Animal`** superclass.
